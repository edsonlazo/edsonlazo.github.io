Hi! Iâ€™m Edson Lazo, a passionate software engineer from Bolivia ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡´ who loves solving complex problems and learning something new every day. While my main focus is backend development, I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge in other areas of tech.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I like to unwind by playing Valorant or enjoying a good cup of coffee. I also love sharing ideas with fellow tech enthusiasts, exploring new tools, and collaborating on interesting projects.

If you have something in mind or just want to chat about tech (or games), feel free to reach out at [edsonlazos@gmail.com](mailto:edsonlazos@gmail.com)!
